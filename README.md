# Arduino-Irrigation-system-for-plant-moisture-management-researchers
This Moisture management system was specially made for researchers who are involved in drought experiments.  Users will be able to simply customize and use this code to maintain the moisture level of the plants based on the weight of the pot. You can use Putty with this Arduino code to save your data in a cloud as a text document. The data will be saved with commas between the data sets, so you can simply copy-paste the data to an excel sheet and extract the required columns.

You can use this link (https://github.com/olkal/HX711_ADC) to download the libraries for the load cells as well as codes to calibrate the loadcells. The calibration values you determine from this part should be manually insterted in to the codes before the trials.
